The next clue lies hidden beneath the sand
Beneath the cactus and the desert land
But beware, adventurer, for danger is near
Just like Arizona Jones, you have nothing to fear
Follow the symbols of ancient lore
And find the map that leads to more
Unlock the secrets of the desert's past
And the treasure you seek will be yours at last.
